# AA First Assignment

The objective of this project was to find a minimum weighted closure for a given vertex-weighted directed graph G(V, E), with n vertices and m edges. Exhaustive Search and Greedy Algorithms were used to solve this problem, and both approaches were compared in terms of execution time, as well as time complexity.
